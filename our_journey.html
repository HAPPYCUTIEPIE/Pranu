        <h1>From Captains to Soulmates: Our Unfolding Journey</h1>

        <p>Hey Pranuu,</p>
        <p>It feels like just yesterday when we first crossed paths. We were both given these titles that made us stand outâ€”me as the captain and you as the vice-captain. At the time, we took those roles seriously, but I never imagined they would lead us to something so much more meaningful.</p>
        <p>At first, our conversations were just about getting the job doneâ€”quick, to the point. We didnâ€™t really know each other. But then came <span class="highlight">29/12/2023</span>, the day of the sports event. After all the adrenaline, something else clicked between us. Thatâ€™s the day we started talking on Instagram, and from that moment, everything changed.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A day of cheers, of wins and loss,<br>
            Yet, the greatest victory was ours, of course.<br>
            For in those messages, a bond was born,<br>
            A simple start, but a love so adorned."
        </div>

        <h2>The First Conversations</h2>
        <p>Our first chats were a bit awkward, right? We were both kind of unsure about where we stood. We mostly talked about school, our roles, and the pressure of being leaders. But soon, those talks started to shift. We went from talking about responsibilities to sharing our dreams, fears, and just random stuff. I found myself waiting for your messages more and more each day, and somehow, you became the most important person in my life.</p>
        <p>I still remember how a single notification from you could make my entire day. It didnâ€™t take long for you to become the person I could share everything with.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "From casual words to heartfelt tones,<br>
            A bond was formed, a love unknown.<br>
            Each day we talked, our spirits soared,<br>
            Together, a journey we both adored."
        </div>

        <h2>Through Trials and Triumphs</h2>
        <p>Of course, it hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing. I remember that one day when I hurt you, and seeing you cry because of meâ€¦ it broke me. That was when I realized just how much you meant to me, how much I really care. That moment changed a lot for meâ€”I promised myself that I never wanted to see you in pain again.</p>
        <p>But through those tough moments, we grew stronger. We had each otherâ€™s backs. And on <span class="highlight">26/1/2024</span>, when our house won the best house award, it felt like more than just a school victory. It was a reminder of how far weâ€™d comeâ€”not just as teammates, but as something so much deeper.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A victory shared, a moment bright,<br>
            But the real triumph was in our sight.<br>
            Together we stood, hand in hand,<br>
            More than leaders, as love had planned."
        </div>

        <h2>The Jealousy and Realization</h2>
        <p>There was a time when things got a bit rocky. That whole situation with that girl (you know who) made things tense. I could see the jealousy in your eyes, even though you tried to hide it. You became distant, and at first, I didnâ€™t understand why. But then I realized that your feelings were rooted in your love for me. It hit me how much I mean to you, and that made me appreciate our relationship even more.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A shadow cast by doubt and fear,<br>
            But through it all, you stayed so near.<br>
            For in your heart, you knew the truth,<br>
            That love like ours needs no proof."
        </div>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>And then came <span class="highlight">23/5/2024</span>. I couldnâ€™t keep my feelings to myself any longer, so I just went for it. I proposed, and you said yes. That momentâ€”itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll never forget. From that day on, we werenâ€™t just friends or partners; we became something more, something real and lasting.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A question asked, a heart laid bare,<br>
            And in your eyes, I found my care.<br>
            A simple 'yes,' but so much more,<br>
            A love to cherish, forever adore."
        </div>

        <h2>Four Months of Us</h2>
        <p>As we near <span class="highlight">23/9/2024</span>, marking four amazing months together, I canâ€™t help but reflect on everything. From those first nervous talks to the deep bond we share now, itâ€™s been an incredible journey. Itâ€™s funny how life feels like a chess game sometimes. Weâ€™ve had to make some sacrifices, like cutting down our time together for studies, especially with JEE preparation and everything. But even on the busiest days, youâ€™re always on my mind.</p>

        <h2>Looking Towards the Future</h2>
        <p>When I think about the future, I smile because I know youâ€™ll be there. Youâ€™ve become such a huge part of my life, and I canâ€™t picture it without you. Weâ€™ve grown so much together, and this is only the beginning. I want to be there for all your successes, to support you through everything, and to face every challenge together.</p>

        <p>Pranu, youâ€™ve filled a part of my heart I didnâ€™t even realize was empty. Youâ€™re my confidante, my best friend, and my loveâ€”all in one. Youâ€™ve seen me at my best and at my worst, and your love has stayed constant. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever told you this, but I admire you so muchâ€”your strength, your beauty, your mind.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m so lucky to have found you, and no matter what happens, Iâ€™ll always treasure every moment with you.</p>

        <p><strong>I love you, PranuuuuðŸ’—... Always and forever.</strong></p>

        <h2>Taking a Step Back, But Always Together ~Five Months of Us</h2>

        <p>Pranu these last few months with u have been something else nd honestly I wouldnâ€™t trade â€˜em for anything Every little thing weâ€™ve shared every laugh even the times we didnâ€™t see eye to eye it all just made me realize more how incredible u r And right now more than anything I just want u to see that too I know it might feel like Iâ€™m pullin back or acting kinda distant but itâ€™s not coz I donâ€™t care or Iâ€™m giving up on us itâ€™s actually the opposite Itâ€™s coz I see everything ur capable of nd I donâ€™t ever wanna be the reason u donâ€™t reach that
           Sometimes life makes us make some tough calls especially for the people we care about This is one of those times I know Insta nd our chats are kinda our thing nd they bring us so much joy but they also make it easy to lose focus sometimes Iâ€™d hate myself if I became the reason u got held back or didnâ€™t become everything u can be This isnâ€™t about me leavin or anything itâ€™s just me stepping back a bit so u can focus on being the person I know uâ€™re meant to be Itâ€™s like how Krishna had to leave Radha to do his duties but he never stopped lovin her Sometimes we gotta step back a little so we can grow
           U have this crazy light in u nd I see it clear as day But right now itâ€™s like the worldâ€™s tryin to distract u nd make u doubt urself or make u compare ur journey to everyone elseâ€™s I donâ€™t want that for u I donâ€™t want u lookin around nd feeling like ur not enough coz thatâ€™s not true at all I know things havenâ€™t been the easiest for u nd itâ€™s tough when it feels like everyone else is on some fast track to success but that doesnâ€™t mean ur path isnâ€™t exactly right Every step u take even the tiny ones are taking u closer to those big dreams u keep in ur heart
           Letâ€™s both promise to focus on what really matters for now Weâ€™re gonna talk less nd yeah itâ€™s gonna be tough but I think itâ€™s what we need Not coz I donâ€™t wanna talk to u but coz I care enough to step back if it means u can give urself that focus u need Just like Krishna still held onto his love for Radha no matter the distance Iâ€™m still here No one believes in u like I do nd I know that if u put everything into this uâ€™ll go way beyond what u ever thought was possible Uâ€™re special Pranu nd I canâ€™t wait to see u become everything uâ€™re meant to be
           Itâ€™s hard nd I know itâ€™s a big ask but trust me Iâ€™m doing this out of love coz I see how amazing u are even if u donâ€™t always see it Just coz weâ€™re talkin less doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not here Iâ€™m still rooting for u every single day Iâ€™m so proud of u in ways I canâ€™t even explain nd I just need u to know that Take this time chase those dreams nd remember Iâ€™m here cheering u on always waiting for the day u hit all those goals Donâ€™t give up nd donâ€™t let anything shake u.
           U got this Pranu nd I got ur back now nd always. ALL THE BESTðŸ˜‰ðŸ’—</p>
