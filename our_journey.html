        <h1>From Captains to Soulmates: Our Unfolding Journey</h1>

        <p>Hey Pranuu,</p>
        <p>It feels like just yesterday when we first crossed paths. We were both given these titles that made us stand outâ€”me as the captain and you as the vice-captain. At the time, we took those roles seriously, but I never imagined they would lead us to something so much more meaningful.</p>
        <p>At first, our conversations were just about getting the job doneâ€”quick, to the point. We didnâ€™t really know each other. But then came <span class="highlight">29/12/2023</span>, the day of the sports event. After all the adrenaline, something else clicked between us. Thatâ€™s the day we started talking on Instagram, and from that moment, everything changed.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A day of cheers, of wins and loss,<br>
            Yet, the greatest victory was ours, of course.<br>
            For in those messages, a bond was born,<br>
            A simple start, but a love so adorned."
        </div>

        <h2>The First Conversations</h2>
        <p>Our first chats were a bit awkward, right? We were both kind of unsure about where we stood. We mostly talked about school, our roles, and the pressure of being leaders. But soon, those talks started to shift. We went from talking about responsibilities to sharing our dreams, fears, and just random stuff. I found myself waiting for your messages more and more each day, and somehow, you became the most important person in my life.</p>
        <p>I still remember how a single notification from you could make my entire day. It didnâ€™t take long for you to become the person I could share everything with.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "From casual words to heartfelt tones,<br>
            A bond was formed, a love unknown.<br>
            Each day we talked, our spirits soared,<br>
            Together, a journey we both adored."
        </div>

        <h2>Through Trials and Triumphs</h2>
        <p>Of course, it hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing. I remember that one day when I hurt you, and seeing you cry because of meâ€¦ it broke me. That was when I realized just how much you meant to me, how much I really care. That moment changed a lot for meâ€”I promised myself that I never wanted to see you in pain again.</p>
        <p>But through those tough moments, we grew stronger. We had each otherâ€™s backs. And on <span class="highlight">26/1/2024</span>, when our house won the best house award, it felt like more than just a school victory. It was a reminder of how far weâ€™d comeâ€”not just as teammates, but as something so much deeper.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A victory shared, a moment bright,<br>
            But the real triumph was in our sight.<br>
            Together we stood, hand in hand,<br>
            More than leaders, as love had planned."
        </div>

        <h2>The Jealousy and Realization</h2>
        <p>There was a time when things got a bit rocky. That whole situation with that girl (you know who) made things tense. I could see the jealousy in your eyes, even though you tried to hide it. You became distant, and at first, I didnâ€™t understand why. But then I realized that your feelings were rooted in your love for me. It hit me how much I mean to you, and that made me appreciate our relationship even more.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A shadow cast by doubt and fear,<br>
            But through it all, you stayed so near.<br>
            For in your heart, you knew the truth,<br>
            That love like ours needs no proof."
        </div>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>And then came <span class="highlight">23/5/2024</span>. I couldnâ€™t keep my feelings to myself any longer, so I just went for it. I proposed, and you said yes. That momentâ€”itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll never forget. From that day on, we werenâ€™t just friends or partners; we became something more, something real and lasting.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A question asked, a heart laid bare,<br>
            And in your eyes, I found my care.<br>
            A simple 'yes,' but so much more,<br>
            A love to cherish, forever adore."
        </div>

        <h2>Four Months of Us</h2>
        <p>As we near <span class="highlight">23/9/2024</span>, marking four amazing months together, I canâ€™t help but reflect on everything. From those first nervous talks to the deep bond we share now, itâ€™s been an incredible journey. Itâ€™s funny how life feels like a chess game sometimes. Weâ€™ve had to make some sacrifices, like cutting down our time together for studies, especially with JEE preparation and everything. But even on the busiest days, youâ€™re always on my mind.</p>

        <h2>Looking Towards the Future</h2>
        <p>When I think about the future, I smile because I know youâ€™ll be there. Youâ€™ve become such a huge part of my life, and I canâ€™t picture it without you. Weâ€™ve grown so much together, and this is only the beginning. I want to be there for all your successes, to support you through everything, and to face every challenge together.</p>

        <p>Pranu, youâ€™ve filled a part of my heart I didnâ€™t even realize was empty. Youâ€™re my confidante, my best friend, and my loveâ€”all in one. Youâ€™ve seen me at my best and at my worst, and your love has stayed constant. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever told you this, but I admire you so muchâ€”your strength, your beauty, your mind.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m so lucky to have found you, and no matter what happens, Iâ€™ll always treasure every moment with you.</p>

        <p><strong>I love you, PranuuuuðŸ’—... Always and forever.</strong></p>

        <h2>Taking a Step Back, But Always Together ~Five Months of Us</h2>

        <p>Pranu these last few months have been a journey one filled with countless beautiful moments nd a few tough ones. I know that right now it may seem like i'm pulling away but this isnâ€™t coz I donâ€™t care or coz Iâ€™m giving up on us. Itâ€™s actually the opposite. Every choice Iâ€™m making is cuss I want u to be the absolute best version of urself. Youâ€™ve always had this incredible potential nd Iâ€™d never forgive myself if I were the reason u were held back from everything youâ€™re capable of achieving.</p>

        <p>Thereâ€™s a whole world waiting for u and I know how hard youâ€™ve worked to get where you r. The only thing I want right now is to see u reach those goals with full focus. I know that insta has been a big part of our connection nd yes it brings a lot of joy but it can also easily become a distraction. I don't want either of us to be led astray from what truly mattersâ€”especially not u. Youâ€™ve got so much ahead nd I know that success isnâ€™t just about today itâ€™s about making sure that every step u take now brings u closer to ur dreams.</p>

        <p>I know things havenâ€™t always been easy for u nd I understand how hard it is to look around nd see others doing their own thing seemingly on paths that look easier or even more successful. But donâ€™t let that weigh you down. Everyone has their own battles their own struggles that might not be visible. Comparing ur journey to anyone elseâ€™s wonâ€™t get u where u need to go it will only distract u from how far youâ€™ve already come.</p>

        <p>In the end I want u to know that this decision this space Iâ€™m giving is coz I loveee you toooooo muchhh to let anything come b/w u nd ur potential. If taking a step back from insta means giving u the chance to focus more on ur studies to dive into your goals without any distractions then its worth it. It doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m leaving Iâ€™m just cheering u on from a place where I know I wonâ€™t accidentally pull u away from what matters most rn.</p>

        <p>Please donâ€™t feel like youâ€™re alone in this. Iâ€™m here nd Iâ€™m always rooting for u even if it means we have to step back a little for now. The truth is I admire u more than words can express. I believe in u more than anyone else nd I know u have the power to achieve everything u dream of if u stay focused. Donâ€™t ever doubt that youâ€™re talented strong nd capable. Donâ€™t let the noise from anyone else around u especially people who donâ€™t understand how unique and amazing u r distract u from ur own light.</p>

        <p>Pranu, I want u to know that this decision to step back isnâ€™t cuz Iâ€™m leaving; itâ€™s cuz I care about u too much to let anything hold u back from what youâ€™re meant to achieve. This space isnâ€™t about distance; itâ€™s proof of how deeply I believe in u and what u can do. I know that if u focus on urself and stay strong, youâ€™ll reach heights uâ€™ve only dreamed of.Remember, even Krishna had to part from Radha at times to fulfill his duties, but he never stopped loving her. Their bond, despite the distance, stayed unbreakable. Just like that, my support and love for u are constant. I carry our love with me wherever I go, and Iâ€™ll always be cheering u on, proud of every step u take.This choice comes from love cuz I see how incredibly talented, driven, and capable u are. U have a light that shines so bright, and I know youâ€™re destined for amazing things. Donâ€™t let doubts or comparisons hold u back. Ur journey is unique, just like u are, and every goal u reach shows how strong and powerful u really are. So focus on u. Chase those dreams with everything uâ€™ve got, and know that Iâ€™ll always be here, supporting u from wherever I am. Donâ€™t let anything shake u. I know u have it in u to stay strong and keep moving forward without comparing urself to anyone else. Ur in a league of ur own, and u deserve to see just how far u can go.</p>

        <p><strong>Keep goin Pranu I'm with u now nd always. Youâ€™ve got this nd Iâ€™m so so so so proud of uuu. Donâ€™t ever give up cus Iâ€™ll never stop believing in u. ALL THE BESTðŸ˜‰ðŸ’—</strong></p>
