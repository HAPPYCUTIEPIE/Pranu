        <h1>From Captains to Soulmates: Our Unfolding Journey</h1>

        <p>Hey Pranuu,</p>
        <p>It feels like just yesterday when we first crossed paths. We were both given these titles that made us stand outâ€”me as the captain and you as the vice-captain. At the time, we took those roles seriously, but I never imagined they would lead us to something so much more meaningful.</p>
        <p>At first, our conversations were just about getting the job doneâ€”quick, to the point. We didnâ€™t really know each other. But then came <span class="highlight">29/12/2023</span>, the day of the sports event. After all the adrenaline, something else clicked between us. Thatâ€™s the day we started talking on Instagram, and from that moment, everything changed.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A day of cheers, of wins and loss,<br>
            Yet, the greatest victory was ours, of course.<br>
            For in those messages, a bond was born,<br>
            A simple start, but a love so adorned."
        </div>

        <h2>The First Conversations</h2>
        <p>Our first chats were a bit awkward, right? We were both kind of unsure about where we stood. We mostly talked about school, our roles, and the pressure of being leaders. But soon, those talks started to shift. We went from talking about responsibilities to sharing our dreams, fears, and just random stuff. I found myself waiting for your messages more and more each day, and somehow, you became the most important person in my life.</p>
        <p>I still remember how a single notification from you could make my entire day. It didnâ€™t take long for you to become the person I could share everything with.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "From casual words to heartfelt tones,<br>
            A bond was formed, a love unknown.<br>
            Each day we talked, our spirits soared,<br>
            Together, a journey we both adored."
        </div>

        <h2>Through Trials and Triumphs</h2>
        <p>Of course, it hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing. I remember that one day when I hurt you, and seeing you cry because of meâ€¦ it broke me. That was when I realized just how much you meant to me, how much I really care. That moment changed a lot for meâ€”I promised myself that I never wanted to see you in pain again.</p>
        <p>But through those tough moments, we grew stronger. We had each otherâ€™s backs. And on <span class="highlight">26/1/2024</span>, when our house won the best house award, it felt like more than just a school victory. It was a reminder of how far weâ€™d comeâ€”not just as teammates, but as something so much deeper.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A victory shared, a moment bright,<br>
            But the real triumph was in our sight.<br>
            Together we stood, hand in hand,<br>
            More than leaders, as love had planned."
        </div>

        <h2>The Jealousy and Realization</h2>
        <p>There was a time when things got a bit rocky. That whole situation with that girl (you know who) made things tense. I could see the jealousy in your eyes, even though you tried to hide it. You became distant, and at first, I didnâ€™t understand why. But then I realized that your feelings were rooted in your love for me. It hit me how much I mean to you, and that made me appreciate our relationship even more.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A shadow cast by doubt and fear,<br>
            But through it all, you stayed so near.<br>
            For in your heart, you knew the truth,<br>
            That love like ours needs no proof."
        </div>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>And then came <span class="highlight">23/5/2024</span>. I couldnâ€™t keep my feelings to myself any longer, so I just went for it. I proposed, and you said yes. That momentâ€”itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll never forget. From that day on, we werenâ€™t just friends or partners; we became something more, something real and lasting.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A question asked, a heart laid bare,<br>
            And in your eyes, I found my care.<br>
            A simple 'yes,' but so much more,<br>
            A love to cherish, forever adore."
        </div>

        <h2>Four Months of Us</h2>
        <p>As we near <span class="highlight">23/9/2024</span>, marking four amazing months together, I canâ€™t help but reflect on everything. From those first nervous talks to the deep bond we share now, itâ€™s been an incredible journey. Itâ€™s funny how life feels like a chess game sometimes. Weâ€™ve had to make some sacrifices, like cutting down our time together for studies, especially with JEE preparation and everything. But even on the busiest days, youâ€™re always on my mind.</p>

        <h2>Looking Towards the Future</h2>
        <p>When I think about the future, I smile because I know youâ€™ll be there. Youâ€™ve become such a huge part of my life, and I canâ€™t picture it without you. Weâ€™ve grown so much together, and this is only the beginning. I want to be there for all your successes, to support you through everything, and to face every challenge together.</p>

        <p>Pranu, youâ€™ve filled a part of my heart I didnâ€™t even realize was empty. Youâ€™re my confidante, my best friend, and my loveâ€”all in one. Youâ€™ve seen me at my best and at my worst, and your love has stayed constant. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever told you this, but I admire you so muchâ€”your strength, your beauty, your mind.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m so lucky to have found you, and no matter what happens, Iâ€™ll always treasure every moment with you.</p>

        <p><strong>I love you, PranuuuuðŸ’—... Always and forever.</strong></p>
