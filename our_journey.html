        <h1>Our Beautiful Journey</h1>

        <p>Dear Pranati,</p>
        <p>It feels like it was just yesterday when we first crossed paths. We were both given roles that made us stand out—me as the captain, and you as the vice-captain of our house. Our responsibilities were serious, and we took them with pride, but little did we know, those titles would pave the way for something much more meaningful.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, our interactions were brief—just enough to get the job done. We didn’t have the time or the opportunity to get to know each other beyond the tasks at hand. But then came <span class="highlight">29/12/2023</span>, the day of our sports event. As the adrenaline of the day settled, something else began to stir—our connection. That was the day we started talking on Instagram, and from that moment on, everything changed.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A day of cheers, of wins and loss,<br>
            Yet, the greatest victory was ours, of course.<br>
            For in those messages, a bond was born,<br>
            A simple start, but a love so adorned."
        </div>

        <h2>The First Conversations</h2>
        <p>Our first conversations were filled with hesitations, with both of us unsure of where we stood. We talked about school, our responsibilities, and the shared pressure of leading a house. But soon, those talks evolved. We started discussing our likes and dislikes, our dreams, and our fears. With every passing day, I found myself looking forward to our chats more and more.</p>
        <p>I remember how I would wait eagerly for your messages, how a simple notification could light up my day. It wasn’t long before you became the most important person in my life, someone I could share everything with, without hesitation.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "From casual words to heartfelt tones,<br>
            A bond was formed, a love unknown.<br>
            Each day we talked, our spirits soared,<br>
            Together, a journey we both adored."
        </div>

        <h2>Through Trials and Triumphs</h2>
        <p>But like any journey, ours had its ups and downs. There was that one day when I hurt you, and seeing you cry because of me was the worst feeling in the world. I realized then how much you meant to me and how deeply I cared for you. That moment taught me a lot—about love, about us, and about how I never wanted to see you in pain again.</p>
        <p>Our bond only grew stronger from there. We supported each other, celebrated each other’s successes, and on <span class="highlight">26/1/2024</span>, when our house won the best house award, it felt like more than just a victory. It was a symbol of how far we’d come together, not just as a team, but as something much more profound.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A victory shared, a moment bright,<br>
            But the real triumph was in our sight.<br>
            Together we stood, hand in hand,<br>
            More than leaders, as love had planned."
        </div>

        <h2>The Jealousy and Realization</h2>
        <p>Then came a time of uncertainty when a girl named Apeksha entered my life. I could see it in your eyes, the jealousy, even though you tried to hide it. Your behavior changed, you seemed distant, and I couldn’t understand why at first. But deep down, I realized that your feelings were a reflection of your love for me. It made me understand just how much I meant to you, and how much you meant to me.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A shadow cast by doubt and fear,<br>
            But through it all, you stayed so near.<br>
            For in your heart, you knew the truth,<br>
            That love like ours needs no proof."
        </div>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>On <span class="highlight">23/5/2024</span>, I took a leap of faith. I didn’t know how or why, but I knew I couldn’t keep my feelings to myself any longer. I proposed, and you said yes. That moment will forever be etched in my memory, a turning point in our lives. From that day on, we weren’t just friends or partners—we were something more, something destined.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "A question asked, a heart laid bare,<br>
            And in your eyes, I found my care.<br>
            A simple 'yes,' but so much more,<br>
            A love to cherish, forever adore."
        </div>

        <h2>Four Months of Us</h2>
        <p>As we approach <span class="highlight">23/9/2024</span>, marking four incredible months of being together, I can’t help but reflect on how far we’ve come. From the nervous beginnings to the deep bond we share today, it’s been a journey filled with love, laughter, and learning.</p>

        <p>Life's like a chess game, right? 🌟 Sometimes we have to make strategic moves, sacrificing a little time together to win the bigger game... like cracking JEE. 😅</p>
        <p>But remember, even when we're not chatting every day, you're always in my thoughts. Sundays might be brief, but they mean the world to me. Thanks for understanding and being the amazing person you are. 💖</p>

        <div class="poem">
            "Four months have passed, yet feels so new,<br>
            Each day with you, a dream come true.<br>
            Together we stand, stronger each day,<br>
            In love forever, come what may."
        </div>

        <p>I love you, Pranati💗... Always and forever.</p>
        <h2>Five months..</h2>
        <p>Soon..</p>
